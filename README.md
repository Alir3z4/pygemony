# Pygemony

If you're anything like me, you're lazy... and then you're forgetful.
By that I mean that you mean to write things (in the future), so you write down
a nifty little #TODO(name) (Or however you comment in your language of choice).
After that, however, you get so caught up in other things that you forget about
implementing these features later on. Not any longer!

You see, I created Pygemony so that I could run Pygemony and instantly have
the todos be created as issues on my Github page. This way, I can always know
what I forgot to implement.

Moreover, Pygemony won't spam your issues page, as it hashes and saves these
stored todos into a .pyg-submitted into your git repository.

### Running pygemony is really simple!

All you have to do is [download the archive] (the .zip file) and extract it.


On Windows, I'd advise you to go ahead and use 7zip or winrar--whichever you
prefer.

Then, you need to go into the directory and run:
```python
python setup.py install
```

After that, you're good to go!

Then, go ahead and run pygemony.py

As this project currently stands, I do NOT consider it complete and I consider
it in very early alpha stages. I have a list of issues available on the
project's github page [Pygemony] which I'm more
than happy to receive help with.
